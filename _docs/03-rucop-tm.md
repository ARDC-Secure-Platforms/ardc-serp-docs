# 1. Introduction

Monash Secure eResearch Platform (SeRP) is a secure environment for
sharing research data for collaboration and analysis, within the control
and governance of the data custodian. Monash SeRP allows the Data
custodian or the delegated project manager (Data Custodian) to have
visibility and control over how their data is being used by other
approved researchers.

Onboarding a project/registry is simple and straightforward. The project
owner places a request to create a project. A consultant will then be in
touch to discuss the requirements and create the project.

Once a project is established and a dataset uploaded, a Data Custodian
can allocate controlled access to this dataset, provide computing power
and approved analytical tools to approved researchers, manage the
controls of the environment including restricting access to the
internet, restricting the importing of other data, authorise all
removals of data and audit the usage of data and compute resources.

# 4. Getting Started

<div id="account-activation" />
## 4.1 Account Activation

To activate your Monash account, follow the steps in the link below. We
recommend that you read all the instructions in this section before
beginning these steps:

<https://monash.edu/esolutions/accounts-passwords/activate>

**Note:** Monash accounts require a strong password. For guidance on
creating a strong password, see article
<https://mon.clients.squiz.net/esolutions-site/accounts-passwords/strong-passwords>

**Your Multi-Factor Authentication options:**

If you have a smartphone, you can use either the Okta Verify app
(recommended) or Google Authenticator for MFA. If you don't have a
smartphone, or don't wish to use your smartphone for MFA, you can
request a USB device (YubiKey or a U2F). You can also use your own U2F
security key.

![MFA Options](images/03-rucop-tm/mfa-options.png)

For further information on Multi-Factor Authentication, see\
<https://mon.clients.squiz.net/esolutions-site/accounts-passwords/multi-factor-authentication>

After successful activation, if you select "continue", a login screen
will appear. It is not necessary to login at this point, as Monash SeRP
is accessed from a [Virtual Private Network
(VPN)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXnDKNy6sA_bqxNFaWkxsG11O8dmEc8T/edit#heading=h.r7d3qd1oj97z)
and a [secure
portal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXnDKNy6sA_bqxNFaWkxsG11O8dmEc8T/edit#heading=h.8u6ad8hxquk),
and these steps are outlined below. However, if you wish to view your
Monash account and access your Monash email, use your Monash ID, e.g.
ext-jsmith to login at this point. You do not need to use the full email
address, eg. ext-jsmith@monash.edu
